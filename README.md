# nyc-flights-EDA Report

## Introduction 
Airport delays is common problem for travelers. These delays ca be caused by different variables, like weather, carriers or destination. So the question we are trying to answer is, are they really the cause of these delays or is it due to other reasons?

In 2013, data about 336,776 flights were collected to answer this question, the data collected from New York City airports: John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to destinations all over the United States and some of its territories (Puerto Rico, and the American Virgin Islands). The dataset can be found [here](https://data.world/bob-wakefield/flights)
